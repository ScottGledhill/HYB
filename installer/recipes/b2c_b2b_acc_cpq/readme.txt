Recipe for a B2C Accelerator and a B2B Accelerator, both with CPQ enabled, running on the same platform. 
In order to create the B2B Accelerator, b2bacceleratoraddon and commerceorgaddon are installed on a yb2bacceleratorstorefront extension which is generated with extgen using the yacceleratorstorefront template.
The promotionengine is installed by default.
For features that require a Google API key (such as the Store Locator, which uses Google Maps), you need to set the “googleApiKey”. For information on generating your API Key: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key
